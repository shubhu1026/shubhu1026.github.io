										<h2>What I'm Currently Learning?</h2>

									<p>
                                        I am currently pursuing my education at Centennial College in Scarborough, ON, where I am enrolled in the Mobile Applications Development Post Graduate program. This course has provided me with the opportunity to delve into the world of app development for both major mobile platforms. While I previously had experience with Android app development, I was entirely new to iOS app development, and this aspect has truly piqued my interest and excitement as I aim to broaden my skill set.</p>

                                        <p>
                                        In addition to the mobile app development curriculum, I am also exploring other vital facets of the field. I am actively engaging in the study of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, mastering React Native for cross-platform app development, and diving into back-end development to gain proficiency in creating full-stack mobile applications. I firmly believe that these skills are essential for a well-rounded developer and form an integral part of my toolkit.</p>

                                        <p>
                                        Despite my dedication to mobile app development, my passions extend beyond this domain. I have a profound interest in game development, and I dedicate my free time to nurturing this passion. Currently, I am focused on mastering OpenGL, a powerful specification that allows interaction with the graphics card. Additionally, I am delving into C++ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to write optimized code, exploring various graphics libraries such as SFML and SDL, and familiarizing myself with game development engines like Unreal Engine, among other smaller projects.</p>

                                        <p>
                                        My enthusiasm for learning and working on these projects is boundless, and I am committed to further honing my skills and knowledge in both mobile app and game development. These pursuits align with my aspirations for a dynamic and rewarding career in the world of software development.
                                    </p>
